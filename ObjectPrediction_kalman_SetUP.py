class ObjectTracker_Kalman:
    """
    This class implements an object tracking system using YOLOv8 for object detection,
    Kalman filtering for object tracking, and proximity-based audio alerts. It is designed
    to monitor movements around robotic arms in industrial settings, alerting to potential hazards.

    Attributes:
        writer (csv.writer): CSV writer object for logging predictions.
        target (str): The class of the target object to track and monitor.
        filename_prediction (str): Path to save prediction tracking data as CSV.
        file_name_alert (str): Path to save alert times data as CSV.
        proximity_threshold (int): The distance threshold to consider for proximity alerts.
        model (YOLO): The YOLOv8 model loaded for object detection.
        cap (cv2.VideoCapture): Video capture object for frame acquisition.
        fps (float): Frames per second of the video source.
        kalman_filters (dict): Dictionary storing KalmanFilterWrapper instances by class ID.
        file (file object): File object for the CSV writer.
        start_time (float): Start time of the tracking to calculate elapsed time.
        alert_times (list): List of times when alerts were issued.
        alert_start_time (float|None): Start time of the current alert period.
        last_positions (dict): Dictionary storing last known positions of detected objects.

    Methods:
        run(): Main method to start the tracking and detection loop.
        process_detections(detections, frame): Processes each detection per frame.
        apply_kalman_filter(det): Applies Kalman filtering to smooth and predict object positions.

        Initializes the object tracker with necessary parameters and setups.

        Parameters:
            model_path (str): Path to the YOLOv8 model for object detection.
            proximity_threshold (int): Pixel threshold to determine when objects are considered close to each other.
            file_name_predict (str): Filename to save prediction data.
            file_name_alert (str): Filename to save alert data.
            target (str): Target object class name to monitor specifically.
            source (int|str): Video source, default is the first camera.
